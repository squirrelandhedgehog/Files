## Explorer

File Explorer just got even better. Meet Explorer, the file manager system that does it all.
Explorer is an open-source, modern file manager system made with the Fluent Design system in mind.

It's designed to be modern and easy to use, with tabbed file browsing as well as the Aero, Ribbon, Metro and
Luna designs out, and Fluent design in. Explorer is made to be synonymous with the Windows interface.

Explorer is just one of the features included in the Maellard update. See for yourself what's in there
after completion!
